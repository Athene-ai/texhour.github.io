This TeX Hour is about publishing. It compares the process with LaTeX
(for PDF) and with Jekyll (for HTML). This includes installation,
authoring and publication.

This website is very new. I'll compare this experience with my much
longer experience of publishing preprints on the [the
arXiv](https://arxiv.org/arXiv). If you'd like to do some advance
reading, this page is:

- created using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site builder
- styled using the [Slate theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate) for Jekyll
- published using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) website hosting

An unexpected and interesting part of the Hour will be comparing:

- [TeX Live installation](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html)
- [Jekyll installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/Ruby)

This Hour will include a live demonstration from scratch, via
[Distrobox](https://distrobox.privatedns.org/), of how to install the
tools, download the sources, build, edit and publish this website on
your own (Linux) PC. What I show is close to the process I
actually followed.
